# RAP-BUI-1-Tiered-Analysis
Analysis workflow and data visualizations for Remedial Action Plan Beneficial Use Impairment 1 - Restrictions on Fish and Wildlife Consumption


## This project is in a BETA phase. I am currently working to add clear documentation and a master file to be usable immediately by users.


# Features

=======
* Automatic generation of Tier 1 and Tier 2 analysis reports for the BUI 1 Assessment using parameterized R markdown report
* Render tables for Tier 1 (AOC advisory levels compared to restrictive threshold) and Tier 2 (AOC advisory levels compared to medians of suitable reference sites)
* Tables sorted by Species, Population (General/Sensitive), and size class
* Output list of species that pass/fail each tier
* Tier 2 table automatically excludes species that pass Tier 2 (optional)
* Configurable options for AOC, reference sites, threshold for restrictive meals/month, and species of interest
* Customizable tables including options for contaminant driver icons 





# Planned updates

* Full UI for configuration options
* Support for AOCs with multiple fishing zones (currently have to generate reports separately)
* Custom functions to be packaged into a... package
* Ongoing bug fixes and efficiency upgrades
